<p><strong>Description</strong> </p>
<p>This custom transformer attributes a spatial representation type to the input metadata records.  There are three representation spatial types: grid, vector and textTable.  In order to determine the spatial type, the custom transformer uses 2 distinct strategies: firstly it analyses the resources{}.spatial_type to extract the spatial type; secondly, if the first strategy fails, the custom transformer is using a lookup table containing the spatial representation type for a list of specific ID (uuid).</p>
<p><strong>Input Ports</strong> </p>
<p>LOOKUP_TABLE_INPUT: Input information from the lookup table</p>
<p>DATA_INPUT: The input metadata records to process.</p>
<p><strong>Output Ports </strong></p>
<p>DATA_OUTPUT_PASSED: The output metdata records for which the spatial representation type was successfully set.</p>
<p>DATA_OUTPUT_FAILED: The output metdata records for which the spatial representation type was not successfully set.</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong> </p>
<p>No parameter needed</p>
