def set_spatial_representation(feature):
    """This method sets the spatial representation based of the resources{}.spatial_type.
    
    The FME attribute resources{}.spatial_type can take one of the following values
    
     - <empty value>
     - a-grid
     - b-vector
     - c-textTable
     
     The method count the number of occurences of each value except the <empty-value> or "" 
     value. It will set the spatial representation to the value that has the most count. 
     In case of  equality the a-grid has priority over b-vector and the latter has 
     priority over c-textTable.  For the spatial representation we remove the "a-", 
     "b-" or "c-" and only keep "grid", "vector" or "textTable" that is set in the 
     FME attribute spatial_representation_type.
